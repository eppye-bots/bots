Plugins Explained
=================

* A plugin is just a zip-file, you can view the contents.
* A plugin has to contain a file (at the root) called ``botsindex``. This contains the database configuration.
* The plugins on the web-site contain example edi files so you can run a translation and see the results.
* The edi files are in ``bots/botssys/infile``; the results will be in ``bots/botssys/outfile``.
* When reading a plugin your existing current configuration is backupped (in ``bots/botssys``)
* When reading a plugin already existing database-entries, mapping scripts, grammars etc are overwritten.
* In the web server log is logged what is installed (logging is in ``bots/botssys/logging``).
* There is no un-install.
* Beware if you make a plugin and share this: do not use e.g. password for an email account.
* Plugins contain source code. This is a potentially security risk. Use only plugins from trusted sources.
* Grammars for edifact and x12 are NOT plugins, and can not be installed!
