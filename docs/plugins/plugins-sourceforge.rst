* alto_seperate_headers_details
    * input: 2 csv files, one with headers, one with details lines.
    * this is processed into one idoc (so the headers and details are merged).
    * Same technique is also usable for fixed format.
* x12_837_4010_to_x12_837_5010
    * converts (physician) insurance claims (x12 837) in the version 4010 to the new, upcoming, 5010 version.          
    * The mapping file is rudimentary, but I believe the conversion is OK.          
    * I found that removing the one REF file creates a version 5010 file that is accepted and processed properly by Anvicare, the clearing house for my commercial claims.          
    * I have included anonymized input edi transactions for Medicare, Blue Shield and commercial insurers.          
    * My approach is to try the translation as is, and to make corrections in the mapping file only if I get errors from the clearing house.          
    * Medicare and Blue Shield provide comprehensive error checking function.  However, they do not yet accept 5010 transactions, even for testing purposes.          
    * The clearing house accepts 5010 transactions, and they work.
* x12_fixed_2_810
    * converts fixed inhouse to x12 810 including calculation of invoice totals etc and partner specific seperators.
