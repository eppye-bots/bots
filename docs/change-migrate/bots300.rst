Bots 3.0.0
==========

* Bots 3.0.0 was released 2013-02-04
* Bigger changes, and a database migration is needed.

Migration Notes
---------------

    **Introduction**
    
    Version 3.0 is a bigger update for bots, view all changes in next section. Overview:

    #. Django 1.1 and 1.2 are not supported anymore. Supported are django 1.3 and 1.4.
    #. ``Settings.py`` is changed. Advised: use the new settings.py, and do your customization in the new setting.py (eg for error reports, maybe database and timezone).
    #. The database has changed. A script is included to change the database. I had no database issues while testing this migration.
    #. lots of changes in bots.ini. The 'old' bots.ini is OK, but it is advised to use new bots.ini, and do your customizations there.
    #. Excel input: does work; but is now an incoming messagetype and not via 'preprocessing'.
    #. Most user scripts will work; many user scripts are not needed anymore because the functionality is provided by bots now.
    #. Some functions that may be used in user scripting have changed:
        * ``botslib.change()`` -> ``botslib.changeq()``. This function is used to in processing incoming 997's and CONTRL!!
        * botsengine routescripts: for 'new' runs in routescript botsengine.py called function postnewrun(routestorun) -> postnew(routestorun)
        * ``communication.run(idchannel,idroute)`` -> ``communication.run(idchannel,command,idroute)``. *Command* is one of: 'new','automaticretrycommunication','resend','rereceive'.
        * ``transform.run(idchannel,idroute)`` -> ``transform.run(idchannel,command,idroute)``. *Command* is one of: 'new','automaticretrycommunication','resend','rereceive'.
    
    .. note::
        My experiences: after changing settings.py and database migration, all works (except for and issues mentioned above). 

    **Summary of procedure**

    #. make a backup!
    #. rename existing installation.
    #. do a fresh install.
    #. copy old data to new installation.
    #. change settings
    #. update the database.
     
    .. note::

        * It is critical to change the settings before updating the database! Bots finds the right database via the settings!
        * If you use MySQL or PostGreSQL: same procedure. The bots-updatedb script also updates MySQL or PostGreSQL.
        * Tested this for migration from bots2.2.1 -> 3.0.0, but works for all bots2.* installations.

    **Windows procedure**

    #. make a backup!
    #. rename existing installation
        * existing bots-installation is in ``C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages``
        * renamed bots directory to bots221
        * also renamed existing directories for cherrypy, django, genshi.
    #. do a fresh install of bots3.0.0 installer (bots-3.0.0.win32.exe)
    #. copy old data to new installation.
        * in ``C:\Python27\Lib\site-packages`` new directories have been installed (bots, django, cherrypy, genshi)
        * copy directories botssys and usersys from bots221-directory to bots directories. Everything can be overwritten.
    #. change settings
        * use new ``config/bots.ini``, adapt for your own values.
        * use new ``config/settings.py``, adapt for your own values. Especially the database settings are important; the format is slightly different (but similar enough to give no problem); critical is using the 'ENGINE'-value of the new settings.py.
    #. update the database.
        * use command-prompt/dos-box
        * goto directory ``C:\Python27\Scripts``
        * command-line: ``C:\Python27\python bots-updatedb.py``
        * should report that database is successful changed.

    .. note::
        If you use a 64-bits version of windows another option is to use the 64-bits versions of python and bots. 

    **Linux procedure**

    #. make a backup!
    #. rename existing installation
        * existing bots-installation is in ``/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages``
        * renamed bots directory to bots221
        * for libraries: check you use at least django 1.3
    #. do a fresh install: see :doc:`installation procedure <../installation>`
    #. copy old data to new installation.
        * in ``/usr/local/lib/python2.7/dist-packages`` new bots-directory is installed.
        * copy directories botssys and usersys from bots221 directory to bots directories. Everything can be overwritten.
        * mind your rights!
    #. change settings
        * use new ``config/bots.ini``, adapt for your own values.
        * use new ``config/settings.py``, adapt for your own values. Especially the database settings are important; the format is slightly different (but similar enough to give no problem); critical is using the 'ENGINE'-value of the new settings.py.
    #. update the database.
        * command-line: ``bots-updatedb.py``
        * should report that database is successful changed.

Changes
-------

    **Changes in database format since version 3.0.0rc**

    Alas; the database as used in the 3.0.0rc version has changed! Changed is:

    * table channel: field 'testpath' is added
    * table report: field 'acceptance' is added
    * tabel ccode: field 'rightcode'->70pos
    * tabel ccode: field 'attr1'->70pos

    **Wrapping of user script functionality into GUI**

    #. For outgoing filenames: can include partnerID, messagetype, botskey, data/time, etc in channel.
    #. Pass-through is option in route.
    #. Zip and unzip files as option in channel.
    #. SSL keyfile and certificate as options in channel.
    #. Excel as incoming messagetype (instead of via preprocessing).
    #. Option in channel to indicate edi file in email should be in body.
    #. Add: communication-out type 'trash' to discard of edi files.

    **Improved 'run' options**

    #. Run options in GUI are simpler: new, rereceive, resend. (Automatic recommunication is possible via bots-engine).
    #. Communication errors are visible in outgoing-screen and can be 'resend' manually.
    #. Add 'resend all' and 'rereceive all' in incoming/outgoing screen; espc. useful in combination with selections.
    #. Indicate in screens a file has been resend; Keep track of number of resends of an outgoing file. Filer works 'over' resends now.
    #. Dropped 'retry' option. This was not useful and confusing. Use 'rereceive'.
    #. Dropped 'retry communication'. Use 'resend', easier and more consistent.
    #. Add: use 'channel' in selects (eg useful for resend selects).

    **Configuration change management :doc:`see wiki <../advanced-deployment/change-management>`**

    #. Use tools to push changes test-> production
        #. Via GUI: write database configuration to usersys in order to compare environments.
        #. Via GUI: read the changed database configuration in usersys after pushing changes
    #. Isolated acceptation tests: run an acceptance test set without changes.
        #. option in bots.ini to active 'acceptance test'
        #. bots prevents communication to 'outside
        #. use seperate path to read/write ('testpath')
        #. do not change counters etc
        #. results of acceptance tests can be deleted/removed
        #. etc

    **Many improvements in GUI, eg:**

    #. 'Detail' screen has a better layout.
    #. Improve: show name partner in selectlist (in configuration).
    #. Improve: show channel-type in selectlist and routes (in configuration). I find this very convenient.
    #. Improve: better sorting in configuration for in django 1.4, eg for routes, codelists, trasnlations.
    #. References in a configuration are better guarded. Eg: when deleting partner that is used in partner-specific translation: user is warned, has to confirm.
    #. Improve: removed charset from channel. This was not needed.
    #. Improve: selections in screens not only for partners but also for partner groups
    #. Fix: download an edi-file via filer could give not-correct file.
    #. Add: keep track of file-size of incoming/outgoing files.

    **Extended partner functionality**

    #. Add: function 'partnerlookup' for use in mapping scripts to look-up/convert partner related functions.
    #. Add: extra partner fields: address, user-defined fields.
    #. Add: send a message to any bots partner from mapping script (use partners as the email address book).
    #. Improve: multiple email addresses in cc field.

    **Confirmations**

    #. Fix: bug in confirmation logic for frompartner/topartner (I had them reversed...).
    #. Better CONTRL-message.
    #. Option to run user exit either to generate CONTRL message or change the generated CONTRL message.
    #. messagetype (for incoming) is now similar to other uses of message-type; edi-type is removed (is not needed)
    #. Fix: better indexing for reference/botskey. This improves performance for confirmations.

    **Plugins**

    #. Always make configuration backup when reading new plugin.
    #. Dropped the date-indication for files that are overwritten.
    #. Index file in plugin always starts with type of plugin and layout is sorted/predictable.
    #. Fix for performance problem when generating plugin for big plugins.
    #. Fixed bug for relations in database. Bug only occurs when reading 'hand-changed'-plugins. 

    **Better handling of 'database is locked'/crash recovery**

    #. First of all: use the jobqueue-server for more complicated scheduling (prevents running multiple engine!)
    #. Different way of detecting another instance of engine is running via locking of port.
    #. If bots-engine finds no other engine is running, but the database is locked this indicates the previous run was ended unexpectedly (eg computer crash). 
    #. In this case bots will do an automatic 'crash recovery'. A warning is still given in logs or via email. Only ONE email is send.

    **Technical**

    #. An 64-bits installer for windows is available.
    #. Runs with django 1.4 now ; dropped support for django 1.1, 1.2
    #. Database has changed. A script is added to upgrade the database.

    **Other changes**

    #. Add: startup script for bots-webserver using apache. Multiple bots-environments can run over one apache server.
    #. Add: user exit for cleanup.
    #. Improve: use external file name in archive.
    #. Add: archive as zip-files.
    #. Fix: port was not used in initializing PostgreSQL.
    #. Less statuses in processing (simpler, faster).
    #. Improve: use unlimited text fields in database for errortext and persist.
    #. Improve: if message in incoming edi file has error in mapping script and/or writing outgoing file: process rest of edi file (there is a compatibility option in bots.ini).
    #. Reworked errors for edi files (parsing, generating). All errors have numbers now (for referencing).
    #. Always read incoming files sorted by name. Reason: predictability. Formerly the read order was not predicable.
    #. Fix: better handling of import errors for user scripts. This could lead to confusing errors/situations.
    #. Add: access to whole envelope in mapping.
    #. Fix: nr of messages was not used correctly when writing multiple UNH in one mapping script.
    #. Fix: bug for numerical fields with more than 4 decimal positions.
    #. Add: counter(s) per bots-run in mapping script; eg useful for UNH/ST counter per interchange.
    #. Fix: enveloping for edifact with keca-character-set.
    #. Add: concatenate function for usage in mapping scripts.
    #. Improve: updated grammar-handling to allow for UNS-UNS construction.
    #. Improve: set explicit namespace when generating xml.
    #. Add: determine translation via user scripting.
    #. Add: user scripts can easy detect what type of run is done via routedict['command']
    #. Dropped: intercommit connector.
