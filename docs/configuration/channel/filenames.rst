Filenames
=========

In a perfect world, filenames are unimportant in the EDI flow. All that is required is that they are unique so no file is ever overwritten. Bots takes care of this automatically by default when creating files, by using counters to generate unique numeric filenames.

But sometimes in the **real world** implementation of system interfaces, you want or need to have specific filenames:

* Because your trading partner requires it
* Limitations of other systems regarding filenames
* To provide easy identification of files
* Nicer for end users (eg. when emailing attachments)

**Input Filenames**

Bots uses `filename pattern matching <filename pattern matching>`_ to select input files. 
This allows you to select all files, or only specific files, from the channel path. Some points to consider:

* Many types of channel (eg. ftp) are case sensitive. ``*.TXT`` is not the same as ``*.txt``
* Files with and without extensions may be treated differently; ``*`` is not the same as ``*.*``
* For **safety** you should use a partially specified name if possible. This prevents accidentally picking up files that should not be there. eg. use ``ORDER*.TXT`` rather than ``*.*``
* For an in-channel with type=file a wild-card can be used in the path.If directory structure is like this:

    * - botssys/infile/partner1
    * - botssys/infile/partner2
    * - botssys/infile/partner3
 
    * Use path botssys/infile/* to read the files in all these directories.

**Output Filenames**

* A unique name can be generated with an asterisk; the asterisk is replaced by an unique number. Eg: ``order_*.edi`` -> order1.edi, order2.edi, order3.edi etc
* (bots > = 3.0) Any ta value can be used; eg. {botskey}, {alt}, {editype}, {messagetype}, {frompartner}, {topartner}, {fromchannel}, {tochannel}, {idroute}.
* (bots > = 3.0) Date/time using {datetime} with any valid `date or time format <http://docs.python.org/library/time.html#time.strftime>`_ specification; eg. {datetime:%Y%m%d}, {datetime:%H%M%S} etc.
* (bots > = 3.0) Incoming filename can be used (name and extension, or either part separately); eg. {infile}, {infile:name}, {infile:ext}

Some examples are shown in the table below.

.. warning::
    Do not change out.ta_info['filename'] in your scripts. Although it may appear to work, it messes up Bots internal file storage.

**User scripting for output filenames**

Bots has the capability to set output filenames with a :doc:`communicationscript <channel-scripting>`; however this requires a new script for each channel and is somewhat complex. Prior to version 3.0 this was the only method available. It can still be used for difficult requirements (but let us know about your needs through the mailing list, we may be able to integrate it).
