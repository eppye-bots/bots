Debugging
=========

.. rubric::
    Standard method using the bots-monitor

* The reports-screen gives an overview of what happened in a run.
* If there are process errors in a run, first view the process errors!
* The incoming-screen gives information about the results of each incoming file
* For each incoming edi-file: view the detail-screen for information about the processing steps for incoming/outgoing edi file (in incoming-screen move your mouse to the star at the start of the line, a drop-down box will appear, choose ``details``.
* View the outgoing files, including communication errors for outgoing files.

.. rubric::
    Extended Debug options

* In config/bots.ini there is the parameter get_checklevel. Set to to 2 for developing. Than all gets/puts are checked with the grammar(s).
    For production use 1 (does sanity checks on get/puts) or 0  (which is fastest, but if errors gives probably strange error-messages).
* If wished, use extended errors: parameter 'debug' in <a href='StartConfigurationFiles.md'>bots.ini</a>; gives information about the place in the code where the error occurred.
* logging. Logging can be found in botssys/logging. Parameters in <a href='StartConfigurationFiles.md'>bots.ini</a> can be set to get more debug information:
    * **log_file_level**: set to DEBUG to get extended information.
    * **readrecorddebug**: information about the records that are read and their content.
    * **mappingdebug**: information about the results of get()/put() in the mapping script. 
        .. note::
            In bots 3.0.0 this does not work (bug). Fix: in botsinit.py, line 188 should be: ``botsglobal.logmap = logging.getLogger('engine.map')``
* Extended log information for some communication protocols in <a href='StartConfigurationFiles.md'>bots.ini</a>: ftpdebug, smtpdebug, pop3debug. This debug-information is on the console/command line.
* Within a mapping script (or other user script) use 'print', output can be viewed on the console/command line.
* Use root.display() to see message content in mapping script:
    * incoming messages: at the start of the main function ``inn.root.display()``
    * outgoing messages: at the end of the main function: ``out.root.display()``

    root.display() is not the nicest output, but is definitely what you receive/have generated.

.. note::
    The errors bots gives for incoming edi-files are quite accurate ;-))

    Tips for debugging

* If a run has process errors, first check the process errors!
* Be careful with character-set/encoding:
    * Can your editor handle this? Be careful with editing files and saving these again, you might run into issues with character-set/encodings!
    * Are you familiar with the character-set you use? Are you familiar with eg utf-8? If not, please check this first.
* In reality, edifact and x12 messages contains errors. Especially when **found on internet**; lot of ISA headers for X12 are not OK!
