Configuration Files
===================

* Bots has two configuration files.
* Mostly the defaults will be OK to get started, but you may need to customize these to your own needs.
* Settings are documented in the files.
* Open these files in your :doc:`text editor <../useful-tools>`.
* The configuration files are located in the ``bots/config`` directory (except when using :doc:`multiple environments <../deployment/multiple-environments>`).
* The original default versions can be found in the ``bots/install`` directory.
