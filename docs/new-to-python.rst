New to python?
==============

**Short Explanation**

    * Python is an interpreted language. This means for you: edit a python source file (eg mappingscript, grammar), save it and run again. No compilation, no linking.
    * Python source files always have extension '.py'.
    * If you see a '.pyc' file: that is an intermediate file. OK, python does some compilation automatically. Never mind, it is not important. Some systems have '.pyo' files instead. Again, not important.
    * Python does not use curly braces ('{...}') or 'BEGIN...END' for functions, loops etc. Python uses 'indentation' instead. Some people love it, some hate it. For me: this is what I always did with all programming languages; now everybody uses the same layout ;-))
    * Links to more learning about python are in the page with :doc:`external links <external-reference>`

**Some tips when you are new to python**

    #. Use a good text editor. This is VERY important. It saves you a lot of time. See in :doc:`tools <useful-tools>` page. Three main reasons:
        * a good editor has a feature called 'syntax highlighting'. This makes it is lot easier to work with eg mapping scripts.
        * a good editor can do a python syntax check on the python source file (a check if it is valid python). This will point you directly to any errors you made.
        * make the editor use spaces instead of tabs. This is an important feature when working with python. Never mix tabs and spaces.
    #. Creating grammars and mapping scripts does not require an "in depth" knowledge of Python, but you need to at least understand general principles of:
        * `variables and expressions <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython003.html>`_
        * `functions <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython004.html>`_
        * `strings <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython009.html>`_
        * `lists <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython011.html>`_, `dicts <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython012.html>`_ and `tuples <http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkpython/html/thinkpython013.html>`_
    #. Start with a plugin or example
        * most grammars are "similar" (csv, fixed are simple; edifact, x12 are more complex)
        * most mappings are "similar" (same functions are used, only "mpaths" change)
        * find something close to what you need, see how it works, adapt it.

**Installing extra libraries/dependencies**

    * For linux lots of `information about installing libraries is here <https://code.google.com/p/bots/wiki/StartInstalllinux>`_. Think this is also useful for windows.
    * A advanced method is using `virtualenv <https://code.google.com/p/bots/wiki/DeploymentMultipleEnvironmentsVirtual>`_.
