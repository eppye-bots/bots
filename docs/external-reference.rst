EDI
---

* `EANCOM <http://www.gs1.se/EANCOM_2002/ean02s4/experts/index.htm>`_, In trade EANCOM is the most used edifact standard. Guides are much better than the edifact general documentation.
* `UN/EDIFACT reference <http://www.unece.org/trade/untdid/Welcome.html>`_, The official source of edifact (the one and only). All other information is derived from this.
* `Stylus Studio EDIFACT reference <http://www.stylusstudio.com/edifact/frames.htm>`_, I have found this page very useful as my main EDIFACT reference. All the versions are there back to D93A and everything is hyperlinked.
* `Liason EDI Notepad <http://www.liaison.com/products/integrate/edi-notepad/>`_, EDI editor/validator free for Windows platform. It provides rendering of EDI/EDIFACT/TRADACOMS/X12.

.. note::
    Please note that the official X12 documentation is not free and should be purchased.

.. note::
    Some of these pages are provided by companies promoting their own EDI services or software, but contain some good information.

Python
------

You don't need to know a lot about Python to get started with bots, but it will help you to do more advanced mapping and user scripts (or even add new features to bots code!)

* `Beginners Guide <http://wiki.python.org/moin/BeginnersGuide>`_, New to programming? Python is free and easy to learn if you know where to start! This guide will help you to get started quickly.
* `Simple Programs <http://wiki.python.org/moin/SimplePrograms>`_, Gives around 30 simple working code samples, gradually introducing more advanced concepts.
* `Google's Python Class <http://code.google.com/edu/languages/google-python-class/>`_, This is a free class for people with a little bit of programming experience who want to learn Python. The class includes written materials, lecture videos, and lots of code exercises to practice Python coding.
* `String Methods <http://docs.python.org/library/stdtypes.html#string-methods>`_, These are often used to manipulate string data in mapping scripts.
