Email Notifications for Errors
==============================

When bots runs scheduled, it is cumbersome to keep checking for errors in the bots-monitor.
It is possible to receive an email-report in case of errors.
Configure this:

#. Set option 'sendreportiferror' in bots/config/bots.ini to True.
#. In bots/config/settings.py set relevant data for email, eg like:

    .. code-block:: python

        MANAGERS = (    #bots will send error reports to the MANAGERS
            ('name_manager', 'myemailaddress@gmail'),
            )
        EMAIL_HOST = 'smtp.gmail.com'             #Default: 'localhost'
        EMAIL_PORT = '587'             #Default: 25
        EMAIL_USE_TLS = True       #Default: False
        EMAIL_HOST_USER = 'username'        #Default: ''. Username to use for the SMTP server defined in EMAIL_HOST. If empty, Django won't attempt authentication.
        EMAIL_HOST_PASSWORD = '*******'    #Default: ''. PASSWORD to use for the SMTP server defined in EMAIL_HOST. If empty, Django won't attempt authentication.
        SERVER_EMAIL = 'botserrors@gmail.com'           #Sender of bots error reports. Default: 'root@localhost'
        EMAIL_SUBJECT_PREFIX = ''   #This is prepended on email subject.

#. To test if it works OK, restart the bots-webserver and bots-monitor->Systasks->Send test report. (I know, the restarting is annoying.).

.. note::
    Email notifications are not sent while running `acceptance tests <../advanced-deployment/change-management.html#isolated-acceptance-testing>`_.
